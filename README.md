# etch-a-sketch
Simple etch-a-sketch responsive web application created as a part of curriculum of <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/">The Odin Project</a>. It was made using plain HTML, CSS and vanilla JS.

As it is functional now, there is some refactoring and upgrades to do. 
I will be back to this project after I finish my TOP.
Some features were based on similar works as learning process.
